### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 23 y/o front-end dev working with JS/Vue.js, but netsec is what I'm really enthusiastic about.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with Python 3 and C + a variety of netsec topics like YARA.

This repo (czarnero) contains solutions to questions, problems and exercises in a variety of languages.
